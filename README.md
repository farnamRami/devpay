## 🌐 What is DevPay?

DevPay offers a complete peer-to-peer payment ecosystem that works without IBAN, SWIFT, or legacy banking intermediaries. It uses tokenized payment cards where both card numbers and CVVs dynamically change with each transaction, eliminating the risk of card theft or skimming. Biometric authentication ensures every payment is securely approved by the user.
