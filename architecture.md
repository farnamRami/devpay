# DevPay Architecture Overview

DevPay is designed as a sovereign, modular, and scalable digital finance infrastructure that operates securely across borders without relying on legacy systems like IBAN or SWIFT. It combines tokenization, biometric security, domestic payment network integration, and cloud-native architecture to deliver real-time, resilient financial services.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🔸 1. Wallet & Ledger Engine
DevPay’s wallet engine is built using a JVM-based core (Java + Kotlin) for real-time financial transactions. It features:
- Double-entry ledger model
- Millisecond transaction settlement
- Currency-agnostic wallet support (IRR, TRY, USD, EUR, USDT)
- Smart sync and rollback capabilities

### 🔸 2. Tokenized Card System
DevPay uses a cryptographic tokenization engine written in Rust. Each transaction dynamically regenerates:
- A new PAN (card number)
- A one-time CVV
- A session-specific token, invalid after use

This ensures near-zero fraud risk in both online and offline scenarios.

### 🔸 3. Biometric Security Layer
Authentication is handled through:
- Native biometric APIs (iOS/Android)
- Local biometric fallback (face, fingerprint, palm)
- Time-limited session tokens
- PIN/password fallback for fallback conditions
