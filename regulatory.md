# Regulatory Compliance & Sovereign Integration

DevPay is engineered to meet the regulatory, legal, and data sovereignty requirements of both the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Türkiye. The platform's architecture is designed around regional laws governing financial technology, personal data protection, anti-money laundering, and national payment infrastructure compatibility.

## 🛡️ Compliance by Design

DevPay operates with compliance embedded in its core systems:
- e-KYC workflows integrated with Shahkar (Iran) and e-Devlet (Türkiye)
- Real-time AML monitoring with modular rules per jurisdiction
- Transaction limits, audit logs, and risk scoring per MASAK and CBI guidelines
- Sanctions-aware FX and crypto handling (USDT, EUR, TRY, IRR)

All users go through an onboarding pipeline that includes biometric ID, national registry validation, and transaction screening.

## 📍 Data Sovereignty

All user data is stored in-country:
- **Türkiye**: Data hosted in compliance with KVKK (Kişisel Verilerin Korunması Kanunu)
- **Iran**: Compliant with Central Bank data residency regulations and the National Information Network (SHOMA)

DevPay does not store or process user PII on foreign servers, nor does it rely on global third-party identity services.

## 💱 Crypto & FX Handling

DevPay allows stablecoin support (USDT) and fiat conversion through licensed partners:
- Real-time FX margin alerts
- AML/CFT tracing for crypto-originated transactions
- Compliance with FATF recommendations (where applicable)
- Central Bank–sanctioned limits and conversion APIs

The system is designed to auto-block or freeze suspicious transfers flagged by regulatory engines.

## 🏦 Central Bank Compatibility

DevPay is architected to work in parallel with:
- **TROY (Türkiye’s national card scheme)**
- **Shetab / Shaparak** (Iran’s switch and gateway network)
- Future integration with **CBDC platforms** (e.g., e-Rial)

DevPay wallets will be CBDC-ready, with hybrid flows for offline or tokenized reserve transactions when government-issued digital currencies are launched.

## 🧾 Audit & Transparency

- End-to-end traceability of every transaction
- Exportable compliance reports
- Regulator dashboards for authorized review
- Time-stamped hashes for all user operations

---

## 🌐 Cross-Border Integrity

DevPay’s SWIFT-free transfer mechanism is closed-loop and regulated through licensed FX partners. This approach allows compliant cross-border digital remittances between Iran, Türkiye, and diaspora communities — without breaching sanctions or exposing user data.

DevPay is more than a fintech app. It is a sovereign financial infrastructure built to respect law, protect citizens, and enable national-scale digital transformation.
